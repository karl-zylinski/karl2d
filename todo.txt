X Make 0, 0 be at top left (should vertex data be flipped, or is it a transformation thingy?)
X Construct vertex buffer from k2.draw_blabla calls. Do we need index buffer? ü§∑‚Äç
X Organize the d3d11 things neatly. It's just a hack right now!
	X enable debug layers
	X asserting on hresult and checking errors
	X clean up on shutdown
* Do proper checks of vertex count and dispatch rendering when full
* Should we sort by depth?
* Load textures and somehow bind to shader -- split draw calls on texture switch -- needs a start of a batch system.
