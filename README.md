___This library is NOT ready for use!___

Karl2D is a work-in-progress library for creating 2D games using the Odin Programming Language.

The API is based on Raylib because I like that API. But the implementation is meant to have as few dependencies as possible (only `core` libs and rendering APIs in `vendor`). The API will not be identical to Raylib. I'll modify to fit Odin better etc.

## What features of Raylib will not be included?

* 3D
* Some maths things that can be found in Odin's core libs

Might not be included:
* Time management (use `core:time` instead)
