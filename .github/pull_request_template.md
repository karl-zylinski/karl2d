A message from Karl Zylinski: Please read the following message: Opening a _draft_ Pull Request is always OK and does not need to follow any rules. I will not review draft Pull Requests. The moment you change it into a non-draft Pull Request (as in _ready for review_), then your Pull Request must follow the rules in the file [pull_request_rules.md](https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl2d/blob/master/pull_request_rules.md). Please remove this message from the Pull Request description before submitting.
