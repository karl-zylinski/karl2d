**Please read the following message:** Thank you for wanting to help. Opening a _draft_ Pull Request is always OK and does not need to follow any rules. The moment you change it into a non-draft Pull Request (as in _ready for review_), then your Pull Request must follow the rules, which you find at the bottom of `README.md`: https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl2d/blob/master/README.md#contributing-and-pull-request-rules -- Please remove this message from the Pull Request description before submitting.
